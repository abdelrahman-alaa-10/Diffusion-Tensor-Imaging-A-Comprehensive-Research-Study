# Diffusion Tensor Imaging: A Comprehensive Research Study

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed research study on **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)** and **Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI)**.  
The study explores both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these advanced MRI techniques, focusing on how diffusion-related contrasts are obtained, modeled, and interpreted.

## Contents
1. **Literature Review**  
   A comprehensive review of the existing research on DTI and DKI, including their clinical and research applications.

2. **MRI Signal Acquisition**  
   - Fundamentals of MRI imaging.  
   - Explanation of different modalities, including **T1-weighted** and **T2\***-weighted images.  
   - The physics behind signal acquisition and contrast mechanisms.

3. **From MRI to Diffusion Imaging**  
   - The process of obtaining scalar **Diffusion Weighted Images (DWI)**.  
   - How knowledge of MRI signals is applied to measure diffusion.  

4. **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)**  
   - Representation of diffusion directionality.  
   - Mathematical basis for tensor construction.  
   - Visualization and interpretation of diffusion tensors.

5. **Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI)**  
   - Extension of DTI to capture non-Gaussian diffusion.  
   - Advantages in characterizing complex tissue microstructures.

## Goals
- To provide a **comprehensive introduction** to DTI and DKI.  
- To bridge the gap between **basic MRI physics** and **advanced diffusion imaging techniques**.  
- To serve as a resource for students, researchers, and practitioners in neuroimaging and medical imaging fields.
